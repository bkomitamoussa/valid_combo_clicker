# valid_combo_clicker

This script automates clicking YES or NO a set number of times for the Valid Combinations section of Survey 2a. When you run it, it opens a new browser. You'll need to log in yourself and navigate to the survey. Once there you tell it how many times to click, and it clicks for you. I am still figuring out the best way to trigger the next click, so sometimes the script will click again (multiple times even) before the next question loads. 

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python

### Step 2: Install Firefox (if you don't have it already)
